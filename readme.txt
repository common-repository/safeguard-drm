Add access rights protection (DRM) to WordPress pages and posts.

== Description ==

This plugin adds an iFrame that manages user access rights (DRM) to the page. Can be added to any WordPress page or post, even to the member login page so that all all members need a token.

DRM tokens are very much more secure than password access because passwords can be shared. SafeGuard DRM tokens are also very much more secure than other DRM solutions because tokens get assigned according to unique computer signatures that can never be faked or exploited. Once a token is cliamed, users can only change device or assign additional devices with the site owners approval.

NOTE: This plugin connects to a third party service for DRM protection provided by [SafeGuard Media](https://safeguard.media/terms.asp). To view DRM protected pages, users will be required to use a secure web browser known as [ArtisBrowser](https://artisbrowser.com)

* Easy install (requires WordPress Classic Editor).
* Insert access rights (DRM) into pages and posts.
* Settings to manage and distribute tokens for urls and users.
* Assign tokens to allow access to a particular page, or
* Assign wildcard tokens to allow access to collections.
* Can be viewed on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android phones.
* Allow/disallow access according to OS.
* Allow/disallow access from remote devices and shared desktops.
* Control how many different devices can use each token.
* Set expiration by date, days or view limits per token.
* Add-on available to automate token creation from WooCommerce sales.
